# Pomodoro-Timer---GUI-with-Tkinter

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

There are six steps in the original technique:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (20 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
